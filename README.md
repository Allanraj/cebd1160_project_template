## Research Question

Based on the connectivity between two brain regions in one hemisphere, can we predict the connectivity between the same regions in the other hemisphere?

### Abstract

Derived from Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWI, d-MRI), we have derived "maps" of structural connectivity between brain regions.
Using these data, we may be able to understand relationships between brain regions and their relative connectivity, which can then be used for targetted interventions in neurodegenerative diseases.
Here, we tried to predict ipsi-lateral connections (i.e. two regions on the same side of the brain) in one hemisphere from the mirrored connections in the other.

- resolution (what did we end up producing)

### Introduction

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about the dataset. Can copy from elsewhere, but cite the source (i.e. at least link, and explicitly say if it's copied from elsewhere).

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

- interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
- suggested next step that could make it better.

### References
